## Basic Programs
This section covers fundamental Python concepts such as:
- Data types (strings, integers, floats, booleans)
- Control flow (if/else statements, for/while loops)
- Basic functions and modules
- Simple scripts like a calculator or a to-do list

## Intermediate Programs
Here you will find programs that build on the basics:
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts
- File I/O operations
- Working with libraries like `Numpy` and `Pandas`
- Small projects like a web scraper or a simple game

## Advanced Programs
This section includes more complex and challenging projects:
- Working with APIs
- Data visualization
- Concurrency and parallelism
- Machine learning models

## How to Use
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/manojkt14/Python-basic-to-advanced-level-programming
    ```
2.  **Navigate to a program folder:**
