- Simple scripts like a calculator or a to-do list

## Intermediate Programs
Here you will find programs that build on the basics:
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts
- File I/O operations
- Working with libraries like `Numpy` and `Pandas`
- Small projects like a web scraper or a simple game

## Advanced Programs
This section includes more complex and challenging projects:
- Working with APIs
- Data visualization
- Concurrency and parallelism
- Machine learning models
